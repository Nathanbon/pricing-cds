# pricing-cds
Two projects:
- Developing a CDS pricer
- Estimate the probability of default intensity from the actuarial bond rates (for different maturities), the risk-free rate, the desired maturity, the recovery and the annual coupon rate. Find and estimate the default intensity for each maturity and use it to pricer a CDS.
